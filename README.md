# ***Blogs API***

<!-- <details><summary><strong>Readme in English! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</strong> </summary><br /> -->

This is a small simple RESTful API for a blog site. It receives HTTP request in one of it's endpoints, checks if the request is valid, then retrieves data, such as user information and blog posts, from a SQL database and returns a response with such data as JSON and a proper HTTP status code.

It also contains a database directory where Sequelize ORM was used to create a local DB.

*This project was part of [Trybe](https://github.com/betrybe)'s web development course and their instruction team provided the dockerization (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml) and the seeders and the connection config for the database.*

## How to use:

This application is hosted at a virtual server at ***AWS EC2***. You can use an API Client (such as Insomnia or Postman) to make requests to the server at http://3.21.122.82:3000/ followed by the endpoint. (e.g. http://3.21.122.82:3000/user )

<details><summary>To run this application locally:</summary>

Clone this repository and in its root folder execute the command `docker-compose up -d --build` to start up the dockerized app.
(Make sure your ports 3000 and 3306 are free as these are used by the containers)

Access the blog_api command line with the command: `docker exec -it blogs_api bash`

Inside the container, install de dependencies with `npm install`

Use `npm run prestart` to create the DB and make it's Sequelize migrations. Then use `npm run seed` to insert data into these DB.
(NOTE: if any error occurs, try using `npm run drop` to delete the DB than retry the process from `npm run prestsart` then `npm run seed`)

After that, use `npm start` to run the application.
Use an API Client (such as Insomnia or Postman) to make requests to the server at your local port 3000 (e.g. http://localhost:3000/user )
